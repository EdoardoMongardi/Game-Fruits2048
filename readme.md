## 🎮 How to Play
- **Goal**: Combine like fruits to create higher-value fruits and reach the ultimate fruit tile.
- **Controls**:
  - **Arrow Keys (← ↑ → ↓)**: Slide all tiles in the chosen direction.
- **Merging**: When two identical fruits collide, they merge into a new fruit with double the value.
- **Winning**: Achieve the highest fruit tile (e.g., the "🍍 Pineapple") to win the game.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when there are no valid moves left (no empty spaces and no adjacent matching fruits).
